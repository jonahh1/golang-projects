# Conway's Game Of Life made in go-lang

I have made cgol in c# before but i wanted to try using go and thought this would be a good starter project.
In both versions I have used the Raylib library to handle graphics because i like using it and it is what I am most used to.

## How to play
 - hold down the left mouse button to paint cells white *(or on)*
 - hold down the right mouse button to paint cells black *(or off)*
 - scroll the mouse wheel to make the game progress stage by stage
 - press 'c' to clear the screen
## How to run
i think this command should work but this is my first go project so I have no idk: `go run main.go`
